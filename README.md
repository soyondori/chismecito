## üõ†Ô∏è About the project
-  This project follows a straightforward monolithic architecture that incorporates a server-side rendered (SSR) web component and a REST API. The Swagger API documentation can be accessed at /api/documentation.

- The codebase architecture adheres to Laravel's standard composition, integrating a 'man in the middle' layer known as Contexts to facilitate interactions with models. This approach draws inspiration from Elixir Contexts.

- By default, SQLite is configured as the database, and the .env file has been intentionally omitted from the .gitignore to streamline the setup process for a quicker deployment.

- This project aligns with the requirements outlined in the [Koltin Challenge](https://github.com/Koltin-Dev/php-laravel-challenge) and effectively implements all the specified features.
